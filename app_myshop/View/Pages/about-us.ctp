<h2 class="title">About uS</h2>


<p>We are a small group of Engineers working towards development of Agricutural Sector by utilizing the power of Web and
	Open Source Technologies.</p>
<p>
	eNursery, founded in November 2011, is a web platform which provides Websites or Web Stores for Landscapers, Plant
	Nurseries and Gardens. It provides an opportunity for Nursery owners to showcase and sell plants over web. For
	Landscapers it acts as a medium to showcase their work and the services they provide.
</p>
<p>
	Customers, garden enthusiasts and hobbyists can benefit from this platform(online nursery store) as they don't have
	to look around for their favorite plant(s) as eNursery brings all the nurseries and gardens under one roof.
